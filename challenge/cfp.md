# Call for Participation

Build mobile semantic apps. Solve problems. Win prizes.

A joint team of researchers from MIT, Dalhousie University, RPI, and Politecnico di Bari are organizing a Semantic Web Challenge at the 20th International Semantic Web Conference focused on building semantically-enabled mobile apps using the [MIT Punya platform](https://punya.mit.edu).

MIT Punya is a drag-and-drop web-based platform for building mobile apps for Android (iOS forthcoming). In preparation for the Semantic Web Challenge, the team has prepared a number of tutorials.

Apps are due by July 15, 2021 with a check-in on June 15, 2021. Results will be announced August 15, 2021 and winners will have the opportunity to present their projects at ISWC.

For more details about participating, please see [https://punya.mit.edu/challenge/](https://punya.mit.edu/challenge/).
