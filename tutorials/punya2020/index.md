# Punya 2020: Building Mobile Semantic Web Apps

Half-day tutorial at [The 19th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2020)](https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/).

Mobile devices have become ubiquitous in today's society, with
functionality ranging from straightforward calendars and messengers to
sophisticated mHealth and augmented reality apps. In this half-day
tutorial, we will introduce Semantic Web and Linked Data practitioners
to the world of mobile app building through Punya, a drag-and-drop
visual programming environment based on MIT App Inventor that
incorporates Jena and other semantic technologies. The goal of Punya
is to democratize the ability to ​consume​, ​produce​, and ​act on Linked
Data. Participants in this tutorial will gain knowledge of how to
build their own apps leveraging JSON-LD to integrate Linked Data from
the web. No prior knowledge on mobile app development will be
required. The first portion of the tutorial focuses on quickly
prototyping mobile apps using traditional create, read, update, and
delete actions on a Linked Data repository. The second part will
explore newer distributed Linked Data technologies, such as
integration with the SOLID platform, device-to-device interaction via
the Internet and Web of Things, and lightweight reasoning through
technologies like OWL 2 RL. Tutorial attendees will increase their
knowledge and skills of (linked) data-driven mobile app development
and a greater sense of how to build distributed apps that leverage
Linked Data.

## Audience

This tutorial is intended for anyone interested in using semantic
technologies and linked data on smartphones. No previous experience
with mobile development is necessary to participate in this tutorial.

## Description

In this tutorial we will introduce Punya, a drag-and-drop 
programming platform for building semantic web-enabled mobile apps. 
The tutorial will begin with an introduction to the Punya interface 
and mobile app design. We will then proceed to build an example 
application that produces and consumes Linked Data graphs in JSON-LD 
format. In the second half of the tutorial, we will introduce more 
advanced tools for mobile apps, including integration with Social 
Linked Data (SOLID), the Constrained Application Protocol extension for 
Linked Data Platform (LDP-CoAP), and rule-based reasoning with OWL 2 RL. 
Participants will then be allowed to explore each of these topics at 
their own pace.

## Virtual Tutorial

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ISWC has moved to a virtual conference. We will run the workshop in a modified format to accommodate the move to a virtual conference. All of the material will be prerecorded. In person, pre-configured Android devices would have been provided to attendees. Since we cannot be physically together with attendees, we ask that participants in the tutorial follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wN5QUk9gVnnmSj6d7lkUeWoMeaMwruUdZD4DXv0rM8c/edit?usp=sharing) to get their development environments set up to save time at the beginning of the tutorial.

The instructions for the tutorial are available as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CJ-uecwaE5kGDX6QFHuZCIwyVlcWJCQ4Xd6iwEfwxZs/edit?usp=sharing).

## Schedule

All times are given in US Eastern Standard Time.

* 1000-1045: Session I: Introduction to Punya and building basic apps
* 1045-1130: Session II: Data-driven apps by consuming and producing Linked Data
* 1130-1200: Coffee break
* 1200-1230: Session IIIa: Brief overview of advanced technologies (SOLID, LDP-CoAP, reasoning)
* 1230-1300: Session IIIb: Independent activities (SOLID, LDP-CoAP, reasoning)

## Materials

Participants should bring a laptop with Google Chrome, Mozilla
Firefox, or Apple Safari preinstalled as well as a phone or
tablet. Android devices are required. The organizers will provide some
devices for those without a phone or tablet, or those who typically
use an iOS device.

Evan Patton did his Ph.D. work at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,
where he studied applications of Linked Data and Semantic Web in the
context of mobile devices, which included developing a mobile wine
agent using OWL DL reasoning and a suite of tools for analyzing
performance of reasoners on mobile devices. While working on his
Ph.D., he also spent time as a visiting student at MIT working on
Punya, a distribution of App Inventor focused on democratizing access
to Linked Data resources. Evan led the integration of Jena into Punya
during this time. Now, he leads the development team of the MIT App
Inventor project and is involved in a number of efforts to improve its
data processing capabilities.

As the lead developer of MIT App Inventor, Evan has organized and
proctored workshops for people interested in app development of all
ages from middle school to working adults, often working with 30 or
more participants. He is also a regular contributor to App Inventor
communities providing insights on complex app building issues. He has
presented at venues around the world including conferences in Hong
Kong and at the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva,
Switzerland. Additional organizational experiences include the annual
App Inventor Summit as well as MoDeST, a workshop at ISWC 2015.
